# Temperature Conversion App

## Objective

The objective of the project is to create calculator that is able to convert Celsius,
Kelvin and Fahrenheit

## General Requirements

- [] The app should be able to go back and forth from any temperature of the three temperatures
- [] The user should be able to input the starting temperature in an input field
- [] The user should be able to change the starting and goal temperature units (F, C, K) using an HTML element, like a dropdown menu or a checkbox
- [] The conversion should be triggered after clicking a button
- [] Clicking the button to trigger the conversion should NOT clear the starting temperature input field
- [] The conversion should be displayed in a separate, dynamically created HTML element
- [] If invalid (non-int) characters are found in the input field, the conversion should not be triggered
- [] Functions should be documented
- [] Follow JS conventions
- [] Use JS objects or classes to make the code look clean
- [] Include 3 links to resources to learn about Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit at the top of the page, after the header

## CSS Requirements

- [] Use flexbox only. No grid.
- [] Content should be centred
- [] Design some basic colour scheme and styling to give the webpage some personality

## Optional

- [] Pressing the esc key on the keyboard should reset all of the app
- [] Pressing the enter key on the keyboard should also trigger the conversion

## Notes

- Remember to work on the CSS after you have done everything else. There is no point in trying to make things look pretty if they are useless
- Focus on the  HTML layout first and then the script
- You could also sketch your HTML layout on a piece of paper or your computer to visualise it and make it easier to work
- Don't just write code. Think about what you want to do first and, as usual, write out the design
